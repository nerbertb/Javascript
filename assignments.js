// CHALLENGE #1

const massMark = 78;
const heightMark = 1.69;
const massJohn = 92;
const heightJohn = 1.95;

// BMI = mass / (height * height)


const BMIMark = massMark / (heightMark * heightMark);
const BMIJohn = massJohn / (heightJohn * heightJohn);

console.log(BMIMark);
console.log(BMIJohn);

const markHigherBMI = BMIMark >= BMIJohn;
console.log (markHigherBMI);


CHALLENGE #2

Use the BMI example from Challenge #1, and the code you already wrote, and improve it:

1. Print a nice output to the console, telling the user who has the higher BMI. The message can be either:

"Mark's BMI is higher than John's!" or "John's BMI is higher than Mark's!".

2. Modify the outputs above to use template literals to include the BMI values in the outputs.

Example: "Mark's BMI (28.3) is higher than John's (23.9)!" or "John's BMI (29.1) is higher than Mark's (27)!".



if (markHigherBMI) {
    console.log("Mark's BMI is higher than John's!");
} else {
    console.log("John's BMI is higher than Mark's!");
}

console.log(`Mark's BMI ${BMIMark} is higher than John's ${BMIJohn}!`);
